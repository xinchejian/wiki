# **Discussion Notes**

### **Dingxi**

Let's talk about how to have good relationship with neighbors, they suggest packaging ourselves as educational.

Neighbors on the 2nd floor were annoyed. 

We should offer more explanation about what we do and how we can be valuable to them.

Nobody would want to have a factory next to their home. Would they be more open about a school?

### 旭辉 sharing

Xuhui sharing - what can we offer? what demand can we ask?

Who can go that day? - Leyis (maybe)

- [ ] make PPT for the sharing. Use PPT for organizatiion sponsorship @jiji. Get video and play (videos from open day. upload to baidu) @changbai

Sponsorship with Xuhiu - can we ask directly?  

We could get space, but money is most important and preferred

Can we sell our talks, like what PPSH does? 

Less than tech - we can talk more about our community aspect. 

NB - we've done some good stuff and had famous people over

Possibility for direct collaboration of installations? -  Our makers can do it but we can't organize.

organize maker events - party in the mall

We can see if we can ask for both money and space. And offer events.

Two criteria to consider: easy to do, fits Xinchejian's role.

Sponsorship shouldn't be an exchange. We are just asking for money.

Get to know them first, we will see how we can exchange, or ask for free stuff.

梦想改造家 ? we offer doing someting like that. get paid

### Makerfaire

We make a sign up form and send to the group

Make a form for Xinchejian - @jiji

# **Decisions Summary**

* Open day: Let's brainstorm and discuss ways to make the neighborhood more accepting to us.
