## How we talk about Lupu

- We don't talk about it being a temporary or backup location.
- When they stay long time, they will understand our peculiar situation

## Membership
- keep 200/m
- all plans open (day, month, half-year)
- pay with mini-app
- track using the whiteboard

## Space Management

- staff takes turns to sit the space. Make sure all times are covered.
  - TODO: have a schedule after each weekly meeting
- staff is responsible for opening and closing the place
- staff is responsible for understanding the machines

TODO: build smart locks

## General direction

Sustainable development (make money!)

## Roles

Robin suggests we should have dedicated roles to push our various efforts.

- Robin: handle cleaning.
Put cleaning supply by the bar.

- Robin: handle lighting


## Worst case scenario for Lupu

- Worst case, we negotiate again and pay our own rent. Negotiate to pay only the inner rooms, aiming to reduce rent to < 10000/m
- Any possibility they will refuse to let us rent?

<!--
### Why did we lose the rooftop location?

- Our landlord didn't make it clear with the building's landlord
- Company downstairs want to fuck our landlord
- Going on TV exposed us
