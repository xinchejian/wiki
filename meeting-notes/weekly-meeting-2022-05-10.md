Hey all, hope everyone's doing ok during the lockdown.

It's a particularly difficult time in Shanghai, and we realized that with limited supplies, it's not easy to get food and necessities, let along materials needed to participate in the quarantine hackathon. Thus, we've decided to extend the duration of this hackathon as well.

Submission is extended till mid July, and we will review them on a rolling basis. Let's celebrate creativity and ingenuity together properly, after this capricious time.

Take care, makers <3
