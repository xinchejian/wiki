## E Center Space Usage

### Jaguar's Proposal

*Got an idea for how to do invitations for the XCJ E-Center space (not considering XinFab in this idea)*

*TL&DR: new wechat group for XCJ E-Center*


*BACKGROUND*

*At MITERS we had this "member" type called a key-holder. MITERS was only open to MIT students, so key-holders would be more synonymous with XCJ's staff than paying members. But the idea was, if a student was showing up frequently and consistently, showing dedication to making things in the space and cleaning up afterwards, and getting a broad familiarity with all the tools, the other key-holders would give that student key-holder privileges. Which that privilege is basically telling them what the door code is and trusting them that if non-key-holder students came in the space on their watch, they would be able to ensure safe use of machines and help the students learn how to use them.*

*IDEA*

*One way to differentiate and separate the two spaces a bit could be to let Dingxi be the training grounds for Key-holders and then the E-Center be open for commited Dingxi members who have passed through all the machine trainings and are trusted by staff to be consistently competent at using the machines (thus becoming a sort of XCJ key-holder). Therefore breakdown would be:*

*Dingxi: invites everyone, completely open to public*

*E-Center: invites only half year paying members (those that are committed XCJ key-holders)*

*Rough Gradient of XCJ Community Levels:*

*0. Hear about XCJ through word of mouth*

*1. Visit XCJ for a workshop*

*2. Machine training*

*3. Day pass for making something, using tools*

*4. Invited to XCJ wechat group*

*5. Month pass*

*5.5 become trusted key-holder*

*-----(can access E-Center)-----*

*6. Invited to E-Center wechat group?*

*7. Half year pass*

*Key-holder*

*8. Management team*

*(What is the criteria for getting invited to the wechat group? Maybe we could have two wechat groups, one for each location..)*

*PROPOSAL*

*We make a new wechat group for for E-Center XCJ branch, inviting XCJ Dingxi members who "rise through the ranks" entrusted with key-holding at Dingxi space and who are ready and want to use better reliable higher tech tools.*

*Then how it would work for parties and big events at the two locations (which could still alternate monthly):*

*Dingxi: open to public, posted on 公众号*

*E-Center: flyer posted in E-Center specific second XCJ wechat group*

*Dingxi would have its regular beat of community serving workshops and activities. E-Center would be more random, events when there is something cool to showoff (like 张琪的项目).*

*(we are approaching the 500 person limit for wechat groups, so this could be a nice 两鸟一石, but how to manage the wechat group is a separate discussion)*


*Anyway, this is just an idea, it may be too exclusive and go against our vision or values. After we finish that vision document Mitch suggested, we'll have a better sense of what our shared vision for XCJ is. But for now, thoughts?*


Nelson：The two spaces could serve two different types of members - for activities and for people who really need to work on their projects。这个房间专门给工作用

Another wechat group for managing this space's issues

John：We can have events but not in the room

Nelson：每个月可以做些媒体收集，让我们看起来更strong

### Qualification for maker+

通过要求半年会员费+training来limit来E+的人

东西不留桌上，要收拾到架子里。这样

use form to ask project。 TODO develop application form @changbai@nelson

once staff approves，invife to wechat group

规定每个月某几天training

## Xinfab Collaboration

SUMMARY：we offer taking care of the tools，and somehow combine xinfab branding with us。We will put a xinfab logo in dingxi road

TODO @john 加公众号管理员

## Operational Cost

电费

实习生（一天60）

定西路space manager

～8000的定西路operational cost。目标10000

纯靠会员费我们需要50个会员。其实之前每月只有10-15会员

如果20个会员，4000有了。剩下6000要工作坊，饮料来赚。

未来会有E+房租
